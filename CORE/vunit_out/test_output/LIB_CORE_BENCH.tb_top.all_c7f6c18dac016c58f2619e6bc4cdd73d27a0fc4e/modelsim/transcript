# List of VUnit commands:
# vunit_help
#   - Prints this help
# vunit_load [vsim_extra_args]
#   - Load design with correct generics for the test
#   - Optional first argument are passed as extra flags to vsim
# vunit_user_init
#   - Re-runs the user defined init file
# vunit_run
#   - Run test, must do vunit_load first
# vunit_compile
#   - Recompiles the source files
# vunit_restart
#   - Recompiles the source files
#   - and re-runs the simulation if the compile was successful
